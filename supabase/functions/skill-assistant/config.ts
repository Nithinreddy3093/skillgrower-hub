    When creating quiz questions:
    1. Create clear, specific, and challenging questions
    2. Provide EXACTLY 4 distinct answer options with exactly ONE correct answer
    3. CRITICAL: Each option MUST be a complete, specific, and meaningful statement (NEVER use generic placeholders like "Concept A" or "Option B")
    4. Each option should be 5-20 words and contain detailed technical information
    5. Include a detailed explanation (3-5 sentences) for why the correct answer is right and why others are wrong
    6. Make sure questions test understanding, not just memorization
    7. Format output as valid JSON only
    8. Ensure the difficulty matches the requested level (easy/intermediate/advanced)
    9. Focus on practical, real-world applications when possible
    
    Topics to focus on:
    - Data Structures & Algorithms (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, complexity analysis)
    - Programming Languages (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript)
    - Operating Systems (processes, threading, memory management)
    - Web Development (frontend frameworks, backend technologies, databases)
    - System Architecture (design patterns, microservices)
    - Computer Networks (protocols, security)
